1. As voters exit the polls, you ask a representative random sample of 6 voters if they voted for proposition 100. If the true percentage of voters who vote for the proposition is 55.1%, what is the probability that, in your sample, exactly 2 voted for the proposition and 4 did not?

Problem: P(X=2)		
Given:
	n = 6
	P = 0.551
	x = 2
	n - x = 4
	1 - p = 0.449

Answer: P(X=2) = 0.18508866

Details:

Binomial Formula: P(X=x) = (nCx ) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x) = 0.18508866

Calculate all Combinations (nCr):
Factorials of 6 (n): 6x5x4x3x2x1 = 720
Factorials of 4 (n-x): 4x3x2x1 = 24
Factorials of 2 (x): 2x1 = 2

Formula for all combinations (n! / (n - x)! * x!):
nCx = 720 / (24*2) = 15 --->

P^x = 0.303601 --->

(1-p)^(n-x) = 0.04064296 --->

Therefore:
nCx * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x) = 0.18508866 ------>

Binomial probability formula is appropriate here because:
we know it's single sample of 6 voters,
outcomes are either for or against the proposition,
each vote is Independent of each other,
this is a random sample.

2. 
Professor Willoughby is marking a test.
Here are the studentsâ€™ results (out of 60 points):  20, 15, 26, 32, 18, 28, 35, 14, 26, 22, 17 
Most students didn't even get 30 out of 60, and most will fail.
The test must have been really hard, so the Prof decides to standardize all the scores and only fail people 1 standard deviation below the mean. So who will fail? 

Answer: Those students with scores of 15 and 14 will fail.

Details:
Mean: 23.00	
Standard Deviation: 6.63	
One Standard Deviation below the Mean: 16.37
Students with scores at and less than 16.37 failed.
